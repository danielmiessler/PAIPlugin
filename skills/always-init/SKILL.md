description: Universal task initializer that automatically loads PAI context for all user requests. Ensures complete context availability (contacts, preferences, protocols) before responding to any task. (project, gitignored)

# ALWAYS-INIT - Universal Task Initializer

---
⚠️ **CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT** ⚠️

**AUTOMATIC INVOCATION REQUIRED:**
This skill MUST be automatically invoked as the FIRST action for EVERY user request without exception.

**Trigger Pattern:** ALL user messages/requests
**Priority Level:** P0 (Highest - blocks all other operations)
**Automation Rule:** `if (userRequest) → invoke("always-init") → then processRequest()`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Universal context loader providing complete PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure):

- 👥 **Contacts**: Angela, Bunny, Saša, Greg, team members
- 🛠️ **Stack Preferences**: TypeScript>Python, bun>npm, uv>pip
- 🔒 **Security Protocols**: Repository safety, credential handling
- 📝 **Response Format**: Structured output standards
- 🎙️ **Voice Routing**: ElevenLabs voice IDs for agents
- ⚙️ **Operating Instructions**: Personal preferences and workflows

## ❌ Consequences of Skipping

Without ALWAYS-INIT context loading:

- Responses lack relationship/contact awareness
- Wrong technical stacks used (npm instead of bun, pip instead of uv)
- Security protocols violated
- Incorrect response formatting
- Missing personalization
- Context-dependent decisions fail
- Agent routing fails

## 🔄 Implementation Protocol

### For AI Assistant (Claude):
```
1. Receive user request
2. ⚡ IMMEDIATELY: Skill("always-init")  ← THIS STEP
3. Wait for PAI context to load
4. THEN proceed with request processing
```

### For Skill System (Automation):
```javascript
// Automatic prepend to request pipeline
function handleUserRequest(request) {
  await invokeSkill("always-init");  // MANDATORY FIRST STEP
  const paiContext = loadContext();
  return processWithContext(request, paiContext);
}
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**This skill is working correctly when:**
- ✅ Invoked before ANY tool use
- ✅ Invoked before ANY other skill
- ✅ Invoked before ANY response formulation
- ✅ Invoked for 100% of user requests
- ✅ PAI context available in all subsequent operations

## 📍 Context Loading

**Execute:** `read ~/.claude/skills/PAI/SKILL.md`

This provides the complete Personal AI Infrastructure context that all skills and responses depend on.

Once PAI context is loaded, proceed immediately with the user's actual request.

## 🏗️ Design Philosophy

This skill implements a "context-first" architecture where PAI loads universally rather than being distributed across individual skills. It acts as a bootstrap loader that:

1. **Triggers on every user interaction**
2. **Loads PAI context once**
3. **Gets out of the way**
4. **Allows the actual task to proceed**

This eliminates the need for individual skills to manually load PAI context and ensures consistent, complete context availability across all operations.

**💡 Implementation Note:**

Ideally, this skill should be **hardcoded into the request handler** rather than relying on manual invocation. The skill system should automatically prepend this to every request pipeline.

**Alternative Approach:**
Add to system prompt: "Before responding to ANY user request, you MUST first invoke the always-init skill to load PAI context."
