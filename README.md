## üéØ What is PAI?

> **Core Mission:** Augment humans with AI capabilities so they can survive and thrive in a world full of AI.

**It doesn't matter how powerful AI becomes if it's not accessible to everyone.**

Right now, AI is trapped behind corporate APIs, expensive subscriptions, and complex interfaces that only developers can use. Meanwhile, billions of people who could benefit from AI augmentation‚Äîartists, teachers, small business owners, researchers, parents‚Äîare left behind.

**PAI exists to solve this.** This project's goal is to give the most powerful AI capabilities, in the form of a complete platform, to everyone on Earth.

### What You Get

PAI is your **personal AI that actually knows you**‚Äîall your projects, your style, your data‚Äîand can handle anything you throw at it. Whether you're an artist transitioning to independence, a founder building a company, or someone managing complex life needs, PAI becomes whatever you need it to be.

**PAI is an open-source, full personal AI platform that's completely agnostic to who you are and what you're trying to accomplish.**

## üåü Why PAI is Different

> *This system is designed from the very beginning to be available to anybody and to grow and scale with you throughout your life.*

- **üîì Open Framework**: No vendor lock-in, complete transparency, you own everything
- **üåç Universal**: Works for anyone, anywhere, in any profession or life situation
- **ü§ñ Platform Independent**: Core structure works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any AI platform
- **üß† Persistent Memory**: Your AI remembers every context, project, and conversation
- **üéØ Task Agnostic**: From writing a blog to tracking medical data to running a business
- **üìÅ Plain Text**: All configuration in human-readable files you can edit and understand
- **üîå Extensible**: Add your own skills, agents, and integrations

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

PAI is built on four core primitives that work together:

**üí° Skills** - Meta-containers for domain expertise
- Package workflows, knowledge, and procedural guidance
- Auto-load based on natural language triggers
- Progressive disclosure prevents context bloat

**‚ö° Workflows** - Discrete task workflows within Skills
- Self-contained, step-by-step workflows in `workflows/` subdirectories
- Auto-selected by natural language or invoked explicitly
- Like "exported functions" from a Skill module

**ü§ñ Agents** - Orchestration workers for parallelization
- Enable parallel execution of independent tasks
- Primarily invoke Skills/Workflows (not standalone knowledge bases)
- Best for background work where results are logged

**üîå MCPs vs Direct Code** - Implementation flexibility
- Use MCPs for standardized platform services
- Use direct API code for domain-specific integrations

### How They Work Together

```
User Intent ‚Üí Natural Language Trigger
    ‚Üì
SKILL (Container for Domain)
    ‚Üì
WORKFLOW (Specific Task)
    ‚Üì
Implementation (Direct Code or MCPs)
    ‚Üë
Invoked by AGENTS (for parallelization)
```

**Example:**

```
You: "Do extensive research on AI agent planning"
  ‚Üì
Research Skill loads
  ‚Üì
workflows/extensive-research.md selected
  ‚Üì
Launches 24 parallel researcher agents
  ‚Üì
Results consolidated and saved
```
