  "plugins": {
    "pai": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

### Research Skills

- **Multi-Source Research**: Parallel research using Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini
- **Quick/Standard/Extensive Modes**: 3, 9, or 24 parallel agents
- **Source Attribution**: Confidence levels and cross-validation
- **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Findings organized by domain with conflicting information noted

### Development Skills

- **Spec-Driven Development**: Constitutional principles, feature specs, implementation plans
- **Test-Driven Methodology**: Library-first, test-first, integration-first
- **GitHub Spec Kit**: Template-driven quality and compliance

### Specialized Agents

- **perplexity-researcher**: Fast web searches and current information
- **claude-researcher**: Deep analytical research with intelligent decomposition
- **gemini-researcher**: Multi-perspective synthesis
- **engineer**: Professional software engineering with TDD
- **architect**: Software architecture and design
- **pentester**: Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- **designer**: UX/UI design and prototyping
- **artist**: AI image generation

### Custom Commands

- `/conduct-research`: Launch parallel research workflows
- `/capture-learning`: Document problem-solving journeys
- `/create-custom-image`: Generate images for content
- And 40+ more...

## Configuration

### Voice System (Optional)

If you want voice notifications, set up the voice server:

1. Configure voice IDs in agent files (`agents/*.md`)
2. Update `voiceId:` frontmatter with your ElevenLabs voice IDs
3. Run voice server on port 8888

### Customization

1. Review and customize skills in `skills/` directories
2. Modify agent behaviors in `agents/` markdown files
3. Add your own commands in `commands/` directory
4. Update `skills/PAI/SKILL.md` with your personal context

## Usage Examples

### Research Workflow

```bash
# Quick research (3 agents, 2 minute timeout)
/conduct-research quick research on Claude Code plugins

# Standard research (9 agents, 3 minute timeout)
/conduct-research latest developments in quantum computing

# Extensive research (24 agents, 10 minute timeout)
/conduct-research extensive research on AI consciousness
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build features with spec-driven development
Load the development skill and say "add a feature for user authentication"
```

### Image Generation

```bash
# Create custom images for blog posts
/create-custom-image hero image for blog post about AI coding assistants
```
