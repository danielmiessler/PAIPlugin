## Configuration

### Voice System (Optional)

If you want voice notifications, set up the voice server:

1. Configure voice IDs in agent files (`agents/*.md`)
2. Update `voiceId:` frontmatter with your ElevenLabs voice IDs
3. Run voice server on port 8888

### Customization

1. Review and customize skills in `skills/` directories
2. Modify agent behaviors in `agents/` markdown files
3. Add your own commands in `commands/` directory
4. Update `skills/PAI/SKILL.md` with your personal context
